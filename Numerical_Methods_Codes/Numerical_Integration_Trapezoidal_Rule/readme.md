Problem Description:  

-> This is a program to integrate a given function numerically using the Trapezoidal rule. Consider evaluation of the following integral:  
$$I = \int_{0}^{\pi} 1 + sin(x) \hspace{1mm} dx$$  
-> The exact value of the integration $I = 5.141592654$.  
-> The computer program can be parallelized in 3 different ways:  
- using critical construct
- using reduction clause
- using parallel for

-> Thus, 3 versions of the program demonstrates how to parallelize the trapezoidal rule for numerical integration in different ways.
