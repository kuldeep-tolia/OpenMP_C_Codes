Problem Description:  

-> This is a program to compute the Fibonacci series using an OpenMP parallelized program.  
-> Parallelizing is not straight forward as there is a data-carried dependency in the recurrence relation of Fibonacci numbers.  
-> Thus, here the task parallelism approach is adopted.  
-> The Fibonacci series has the following integer sequence:  
$$0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...$$
