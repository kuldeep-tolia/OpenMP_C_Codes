-> This section has computer programs that implements solution procedures for solving linear and non-linear algebraic equations, ordinary differential equations (ODE) and partial differential equations (PDE).  
-> Finite Difference Method (FDM) forms the basis of the discretization of the governing equations.  
-> The programs are parallelized using OpenMP and the speedup performance of the parallelized codes is measured.    
-> To check the syntax/operation of a particular OpenMP clause/construct, you may refer to the following websites which provides description of each clause/construct:  
- https://www.openmp.org/
- https://rookiehpc.github.io/openmp/docs/index.html

-> To compile and run the codes, I have used gcc compiler.  
-> Compiling and running a C program:  
- $ gcc -fopenmp file_name.c -g -Wall -lm -o ./output_name.out
- $ ./output_name.out <num_thread>
